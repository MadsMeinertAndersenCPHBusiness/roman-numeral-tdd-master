 # Give your thoughts on TDD
 ## What was positive and good using TDD?
 The obviously best thing about TDD, is that your software is always unit tested. I've tried unit testing once before this, and each time I'm surpise how fast it actually is. For some reason I physically think TDD is going to take longer than writing my features and then test it, but it always turn out the oppisite way. TDD also makes sure you have good code because of the fact that you refactor quite often. When I have developed without TDD and browsed through some old code, I've often thought "Wauw - this is some pasta code, this could have been writting a lot better". 
 
 ## What was annoying or difficult
I always find it difficult to get into the rythm of TDD. It's mentally difficult to write the smallest implementation first, because you kind of have an idea, inside your head, on how the final product is going to look. This means that I usually find the beginning of TDD annoying, because you write a lot of if/switch-statements, but you kind of already know, that it's not going to look like this later. 

## What surprised you?
Since this is my second time trying TDD, I'm always surprised on how fast it actually is, once you get the hang of it. 

## Did TDD help you write some tests you wouldnâ€™t otherwise have thought of?
This is kind of hard to answer, since I haven't really used tests that much throughout my education so far. I'm sure it helps to write tests that you normally wouldn't have thought of, but since the test subject is kind of new to me, I don't really think about tests than much.
